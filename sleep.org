#+title: sleep
Currently, I do /not/ sleep well ðŸ˜ž...I wake up many times during the night, my back is uncomfortable, and I'm often not calm by bedtime. So here I'm collecting some concrete actions to help me sleep better.

* Principles
** Regularity
- No Naps
- Bedtime Ritual - Meditation / physical journal
- Wake time: 9-9:30
- Earliest possible bedtime: 12

** Increase Sleep Drive
- No Naps
- Get daylight + exercise
- Limit Blue light at night - journal on paper (I know, I know you don't want to...)
** Break out of Anxious Feedback Loops
- Bedtime Ritual - Meditation / physical journal
** Good Sleep Conditions
- window cracked open, less CO_2
- No clutter
** Sleep Posture
- Sleep on Back: try methods that keep me from flipping during the night.
- Sleep on Stomach: try pelvis/knee pillow
