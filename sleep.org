#+title: sleep
Currently, I do /not/ sleep well ðŸ˜ž...I wake up many times during the night, my back is uncomfortable, and I'm often not calm by bedtime. So here I'm collecting some concrete actions to help me sleep better.

* Principles
** Regularity
- No Naps
- Bedtime Ritual - Meditation / physical journal
- Earliest possible bedtime: 2
- Wake time: 9

** Increase Sleep Drive
- No Naps
- Get daylight + exercise
- Limit Blue light at night - journal on paper (I know, I know you don't want to...)
** Break out of Anxious Feedback Loops
- Bedtime Ritual - Meditation / physical journal
** Good Sleep Conditions
- window cracked open, less CO_2
- No clutter
** Sleep Posture
- Sleep on Back: try methods that keep me from flipping during the night.
- Sleep on Stomach: try pelvis/knee pillow
* Sleep Log
In order to quantitatively track my progress with sleep restriction, I'm keeping a sleep log that tracks my sleep efficiency, sleep/wake times, and general quality of sleep.
| Date | T_{inbed}  | T_{asleep} | Bedtime | Wakeup | How I'm feeling                                                                                  |
|------+------------+------------+---------+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4/25 |            |            |         |             | Here's a whole long thing about how I'm feeling. I'm going to continue in this manner for a bit. |
