#+TITLE: starting points

So, what am I trying to do with my digital garden? Good question. Some possibilities are that I'm trying to record and connect the knowledge that I'm learning. That's valuable. Another possibility is that I want to create some original posts, synthesizing knowledge in new ways. Also seems valuable. Yet another possibility is me storing links and things like acorns for the winter. This...not so valuable.
