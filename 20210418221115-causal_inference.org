#+title: causal inference

So I read the [[pdf:~/Dropbox/Apps/GoodNotes 5/GoodNotes/HCI/On Pearl’s Hierarchy and the Foundations of Causal Inference.pdf][On Pearl’s Hierarchy and the Foundations of Causal Inference]] more deeply, and I think I get the mathematics of it now.
So L1, L2, and L3 represent observational, interventional, and counterfactual layers, respectively.
L2 inference requires more model specification than L1, and L3 requires more than L2.

$\mathcal{L}_1$ supports terms like $P(\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{y})$
$\mathcal{L}_2$ supports terms like $P(\mathbf{Y_x}=\mathbf{y})$
$\mathcal{L}_3$ supports terms like $P(\mathbf{Y_x}=\mathbf{y},...,\mathbf{Z_w}=\mathbf{z})$

In other words,

$\mathcal{L}_1$ supports no intervention (or the empty intervention, I guess.)
$\mathcal{L}_2$ supports only one intervention.
$\mathcal{L}_3$ supports multiple (potentially) inconsistent interventions.
