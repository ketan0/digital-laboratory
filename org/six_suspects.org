#+title: Six Suspects ðŸ‘¥ðŸ‘¥ðŸ‘¥

Overall thoughts on the book:
- Heh. Felt like a crash course in Indian politics (and the corruption therein.)
- Interesting to see just how multicultural of a society India is.
- it was amusing to see an Indian author's impression of an American, "Larry Page." One the one hand you could be like, "oh, haha look at this terrible character of an American"; instead, I like to choose to lean into the caricature and
- Is it a "thing" in murder mysteries and/or James Bond-esque stuff that there has to be so much...male fan service? Lots of women in the book seem to exist only as cogs in the plot machinery for the main men. With the notable exception of Shabnam Saxena, that is.
