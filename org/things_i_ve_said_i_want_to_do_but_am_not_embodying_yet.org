#+title: things I've said I want to do (but am not embodying yet)

Things I've said I want to do...

- read more books (reading every night before bed, in a pleasant ritualistic kind of way)
- read more academic papers (even about non-ML stuff, like nutrition science!) and critically evaluate their claims, discuss with others, write responses, etc.
- write a "How to Live a Life" for myself
- being â€‹~ prolific ~ -- high bias to action, creative outputs like blogposts, videos, twitter, projects, etc
- going for long walks every day
