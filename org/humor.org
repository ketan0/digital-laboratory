#+title: humor

what is humor? things that are unexpected, but in a "humorous" way? Ok, that's tautological. But still. definitely something that I want to think about, [[id:4bba82cd-9443-4496-8896-81323093ec11][notes I'm actively working on]].

As a kind of [[id:c244f543-2917-4b32-8bde-883a3e1d5361][meta]] example, while I'm here writing this note in [[id:1999996d-b676-4fc4-894b-caf82f8dd7ff][emacs]], I found myself naturally laughing at the fact that org-mode interpets the ~+~ signs in the encrypted PGP message in my org-journal files as a +strikethrough+, so parts of the PGP message are struck through. Even though strikethrough and org-crypt are both /bona fide/ features of org, no one really noticed this little harmless, unintended interaction between the two (huh, there's the connection to [[id:87e83cf3-3dfa-4486-845d-155895a9f6b6][modularity]]!). Lmao.
