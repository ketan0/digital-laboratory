How to take care of my body?

Hah. I'll admit it, over the COVID pandemic, I've become a bit...skinny-fat. My overall frame is still fairly skinny, but I've accumulated fat in my belly. I want to follow the advice in https://outlift.com/skinny-with-belly-fat/#0-why-are-you-skinny-with-belly-fat -- namely, eating whole foods and doing (once again) resistance training.

When I move to SF, I think I'll get a gym membership -- also, I want to get back to playing soccer. Maybe I'll find some rec soccer league to join.
