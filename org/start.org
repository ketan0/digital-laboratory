Oh hey, you've stumbled on my corner of the web. This is a repository for my thoughts, learnings, questions, and connections between those things. Many pages are incomplete / rather discombobulated -- that's because these are working notes, rather than finished 'blog posts' or something like that. Some elements will become more complete / coherent over time. :)
