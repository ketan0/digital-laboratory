Meeting with Gui, Breno, and Karn on July 5th, 2022.

* Conversational threads
** About me (filtered for this convo)
- 2016-ish: really interested in structures of all kinds
- 2017-ish: discovered Symbolic Systems at Stanford - felt that it called to me.
- Turing Test /  [[id:b7e233f7-62f3-408f-9244-3d486a1e847d][Why People Think Computers Can't]]: seminal moment for me in thinking about the nature of intelligence (related to [[id:c0cd7676-3ef5-4cb8-8ab9-f351f3ce3dc7][What the fuck is "cognition" after all?]])
  - studying artificial intelligence was an outgrowth of this inspirational moment
- 2018-ish: had the idea for Thoughtset -- being able to subset my thoughts in various ways
  treating each thought as an "atom" -- can collect the atoms in different organizations
  - didn't quite have the technical skills to express it yet
- 2019-ish: got very into vim, keyboard shortcuts, "system config" kind of stuff-- crazy how vim keybindings become subconscious after a certain point ü§Ø
- 2020-ish: became aware of roam / org-roam, becoming (more) interested in knowledge graphs, etc.
  - interest in [[id:40ab35a4-500b-4724-bd65-eb4e0b0b02b6][knowledge graph]]s, [[id:79c8e056-1bea-44c8-8a43-66292cf0bd48][emacs]], [[id:4ca02697-506c-4910-bf5e-ce8dcb2da5a5][systems]], all started to intertwine in this COVID era
- 2022-ish: meeting Gui, reading Designing Freedom, becoming aware of the societal perspective on systems. or the systems perspective on society?
- future:
  - integrating the cybernetics / societal systems perspective that Gui has exposed me to into my work. working to create structures that increase individual freedom
  - who knows...?
** "What is cognition?" from a cognitive science perspective.
Mostly inspired by /Other Minds/ by Peter Godfrey-Smith, Chapter 2: A History of Animals.

Nervous system is a very /costly/ machine -- why do we have one in the first place? two schools:
*** School 1: Sensorimotor view of nervous system
The nervous system "bridges the gap" between perception and action.
*** School 2: Coordination view of nervous system
We are big, multicellular, multi-system beings. It takes a powerful nervous system to coordinate all of those things
~ the thousands of "micro-actions" => "macro-actions"
*** Each frame has its merits -- but perhaps the first frame has been too dominant in cognitive science (and society at large.) viewing us behavioristically, as input-output mechansisms
This coordination piece is important -- and if we view our internal cognition as analogous to social cognition, then the coordination piece needs to be solved both on an individual level and a societal level.
** [[id:def74678-76b6-4eae-9908-4a82bad04a0b][üåå digital nebula]] as a way of "pinching" certain threads in my knowledge graph
Just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is possible -- methods of organization of our thoughts, our knowledge. This is like a prototype of a prototype.

technology is imperfect, we're not always capable of [[id:1bdb5bd1-008d-4308-874b-801f25c4a393][expressing]] things that we want to express - have to work within current systems (org-roam, Roam, Anki, etc.) that enable certain modes of expression.

It's not so much about the tool, but how you use it (and if you use it at all! A system that is not used (consistently) isn't very useful)

** uneven distribution of technologies
[open to convo]
** drafting vs. publishing stacks
Seems like the tools for ideation and publishing / conveying to others effectively are quite different.

Current solution (for me) = using org-mode, publishing to HTML, etc..."forever draft" = basically what it is

But it'd be nice to have "finished" pieces too. I can talk a bit about what I /want/ this space to turn into, which is less effective than what it actually is -- but I don't just necessarily want my digital garden to be a random grab-bag of stuff. I'd appreciate if some stuff was "finished," "coherent," "understandable." I guess it's different needs for different things. Notes for myself don't need to be 'finished' per se...but a blog post, or a book written for other people does have some finality to it...

question: is "forever draft" a good thing?
** [[id:058bef0b-aba6-4ac6-b4ae-b3c7b7e22040][‚§¥Ô∏è shortcuts]] as a worm that has eaten into my habits
Not sure whether they're good or bad, but they're powerful, that's all I'll say. Reducing the friction to certain actions that I find favorable, to the point where I do them subconsciously, is powerful.
** [[id:3e676e0c-65d7-44ee-9886-324b82878b28][üîÅ  spaced repetition]]: how to intentionally remember things
can be a Anki-style system, a la [[id:80f83e7d-cd8b-4eeb-b8c1-ab8258340c78][Augmenting Long-term Memory]]

can be a system like this -- node's degree is rough proxy for how much it should be repeated / traversed
connectivity is very important, in this frame.
** üéí Random grab-bag of stuff I've been thinking about recently:
*** Was the cognitive, day-to-day experience of living in the early 2000s a lot different than now? (In other words, how did smartphones (as opposed to personal computers / Internet) change the thought patterns of an entire civilization?)
specifically angling towards the focusing / attention aspects of cognition...

- phone feels like an extension of my body, a weak form of brain-computer interface
- hesitate to immediately jump to a "good changes" / "bad changes" frame
- I am "close" to lots, lots more knowledge than before - friction to connect with people over the Internet is much lower
  - don't have to boot up a desktop computer to talk to people - more like, oh, let's see what other people are saying in my pocket, or on my wrist
- probably has changed dopamine / reward circuitry a lot
  - lots of stimulating content available to us -- crave that kind of content
  - shortening attention spans
**** Follow-up question: how can we redesign technology in a way that makes us more thoughtful / attentive / able to follow threads deeply, without getting distracted?
- notifications seem like they have a huge effect on attention: how could those systems be redesigned (but we still get notified of important things at appropriate times?)
*** how can we use software to modulate our [[id:2e1955ad-af09-4bcd-8b8d-4a0838e96365][attention]] to various things?
**** Nota: flashes the point which you jumped to
*** a family (or other social organizational unit) - greater than the sum of its parts. the relationships / interactions between the nodes are very important in reinforcing the emergent concept of "family"
Interesting to note cultural differences: girlfriend is Tamil, and the family bonds are very strong (calling/texting parents every day / nearly every day,) whereas I communicate with my parents about once a week on average...structures that are very divergent in their interactions can still be called a "family"...
*** two discrete activities: programming and using a program....
Related to what Karn was saying about the uneven distribution of technologies, and what sorts of control an individual has over their computer...

Ultimately, this is just a frame on what we're doing with computers. We're all manipulating state of computers -- but only /some/ of us know how to pull certain marionette strings within the computer to make it do certain things...

maybe we can seek to, a la end-user programming, blur the distinction between these two things?

interesting, and maybe esoteric connection: person who doesn't have the pre-requisite knowledge/skills to be an artist can use DALL-E. DALL-E blurs the line between programming and using a program. the "puppet fingers" are more extensive. Could we use DALL-E as a model of how end-users can be afforded more control, in an input language they understand? (GRANTED: still mostly elites using DALL-E, so the irony is not lost on me, lol.)
