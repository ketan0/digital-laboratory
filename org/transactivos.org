Meeting with Gui, Breno, and Karen on July 5th, 2022.

* Conversational threads
** About me
- really interested in structures of all kinds
- Symbolic Systems
- Turing Test /  [[id:b7e233f7-62f3-408f-9244-3d486a1e847d][Why People Think Computers Can't]]: seminal moment for me in thinking about the nature of intelligence (related to [[id:c0cd7676-3ef5-4cb8-8ab9-f351f3ce3dc7][What the fuck is "cognition" after all?]])
  - studying artificial intelligence was an outgrowth of this inspirational moment
- 2020-ish: began using Emacs, becoming interested in knowledge graphs, etc.
- interest in knowledge graphs, emacs, systems, all intertwined
** [[id:def74678-76b6-4eae-9908-4a82bad04a0b][üåå digital nebula]] as a way of "pinching" certain threads in my knowledge graph
Just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is possible -- methods of organization of our thoughts, our knowledge. This is like a prototype of a prototype.

technology is imperfect, we're not always capable of [[id:1bdb5bd1-008d-4308-874b-801f25c4a393][expressing]] things that we want to express - have to work within current systems (org-roam, Roam, Anki, etc.) that enable modes of expression.

It's not so much about the tool, but how you use it

95% of Anki's value comes from 5% of the features

** [[id:3e676e0c-65d7-44ee-9886-324b82878b28][üîÅ  spaced repetition]]: how to intentionally remember things
can be a Anki-style system, a la [[id:80f83e7d-cd8b-4eeb-b8c1-ab8258340c78][Augmenting Long-term Memory]]

can be a system like this -- node's degree is rough proxy for how much it should be repeated / traversed
connectivity is very important, in this frame.
** üéí Random grab-bag of stuff I've been thinking about recently:
*** Was the cognitive, day-to-day experience of living in the early 2000s a lot different than now? (In other words, how did smartphones (as opposed to personal computers / Internet) change the thought patterns of an entire civilization?)
specifically angling towards the focusing / attention aspects of cognition...

- phone feels like an extension of my body, a weak form of brain-computer interface
- hesitate to immediately jump to a "good changes" / "bad changes" frame
- I am "close" to lots, lots more knowledge than before - friction to connect with people over the Internet is much lower
  - don't have to boot up a desktop computer to talk to people - more like, oh, let's see what other people are saying in my pocket, or on my wrist
- probably has changed dopamine / reward circuitry a lot
  - lots of stimulating content available to us -- crave that kind of content
  - shortening attention spans
**** Follow-up question: how can we redesign technology in a way that makes us more thoughtful / attentive / able to follow threads deeply, without getting distracted?
- notifications seem like they have a huge effect on attention: how could those systems be redesigned (but we still get notified of important things at appropriate times?)
*** a family (or other social organizational unit) - greater than the sum of its parts. the relationships / interactions between the nodes are very important in reinforcing the emergent concept of "family"
Interesting to note cultural differences: my girlfriend is Tamil, and the family bonds are very strong (calling/texting parents every day / nearly every day,) whereas I communicate with my parents about once a week on average
