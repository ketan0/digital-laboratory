** Sound waves are Longitudinal waves
Vocal tract is basically air moving through a tube, with a certain size/length of the tube.
* Chatbots vs. Dialog systems
The goal of chatbots is to produce natural, human-like conversations.

The goal of *dialog systems* is to accomplish a particular task. Naturalness / human-like chat is a "nice to have," but not essential
* Text-to-speech (TTS)

** Tacotron
classic encoder decoder model w/ attention
** FastSpeech
classic seq2seq transformer -- end-to-end
** Vocoders (spectrograms => speech)
** GlowTTS
Combines a lot of the good things: flexiblity of Tacotron, speed of FastSpeech
** VITS
** Generative spoken language modeling
wav2vec2 + GPT-style transformer = you can have conversations entirely in the audio space! audio-to-audio models (rather than using ASR)
