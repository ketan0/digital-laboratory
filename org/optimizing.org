I think that optimizing for clear, measurable metrics is a powerful [[id:bf96c1eb-3ce0-4d7a-b2ae-e44f2fbdf240][frame]]. Dan Luu talks about how one can get better at their craft in https://danluu.com/p95-skill/ -- [[id:7fd55afc-19d5-4f5c-918b-b90a2073b0f0][practice]] in an intentional way.

* Optimizing for good goals
On the flip side, it's crucial to deeply consider what you're optimizing for, and why. There's been some (rightful) pushback against "optimization mindset" in Silicon Valley.
