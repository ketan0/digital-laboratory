As usual, Andy Matuschak has some really striking [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ruCqbkUjU7U8MD5gaMjzmJV4GuENJ3ie1LP?stackedNotes=zrQz6Eqcnrf3QqEf4A92J5bMSwED9KtMZje&stackedNotes=z8BENejnm5iyqRUodaqyScehdgnuu9b1vn669][notes]] on this topic.

In particular, I like his exhortations to get [[id:ef59c729-e9b5-4cca-a16c-7b8ec9d37bce][curious]] and get [[id:f8afdaff-9e8c-4a7e-adf5-84e76794d9c7][bored]]. Those two aren't mutually exclusive, and in fact seem to go hand in hand.

Copying here some sane defaults that he lists (seems like a good support on my way to being [[id:28ad325b-5438-4b37-aa60-607d54ee84c1][intentional]]):
* Partial list of practices meant to produce deliberateness, receptivity [16%]

Andy says: "I’m not sure this is a great practice: A rigid fixation on “focus” can harm creative work. The block ends in the evenings, so I tend to do my meandering then, but I don’t know if that’s too rigid."
** TODO Answer email in batches, usually in the evening or when feeling low-energy
** TODO Usually accept at most one meeting per day, at 5PM, to keep daytime calendar totally open
