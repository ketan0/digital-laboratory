#+TITLE: analogy

Inspiration: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8m7lFQ3njk][Hofstadter]]

The special magic of the mind: endless, limitless _chunking_ .

This is in the spirit of [[file:decomposition.org][decomposition]]. Abstract it away, and it /just works/. Building hierarchical concepts...except they're not quite hierarchical, right? I think I'll need to build more knowledge graph to really see this clearly.

"There is no fundamental difference between a category and a concept."

I think that a smart zettelkasten is /self-referential/. A la Hoftstadter, it's got some material on the meta level, examining its own structure and exposing it in interesting ways.

Example:

Have a node that explicitly looks at different levels of hierarchy.

* Examples
** My brain saw the analogy between me refiling my sock from my dresser to my laundry basket, and me refiling a heading+subtree in org mode.
