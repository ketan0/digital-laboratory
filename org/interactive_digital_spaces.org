(meta; has a TON of links to such articles)
* [[http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1][Biochemical Pathways]] -- a zoomable digital space.
Giant chart of biochemical processes. Whoa.
* [[http://probmods.org/][probmods.org]] -- interactive probabilistic programming / Bayesian cognition textbook
* [[https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/][The Building Blocks of Interpretability]]
this feels like the perfect paper to use the interactive medium on. We want neural networks to be interpretable -- to be played with, interacted with, understood.

* [[https://github.com/norvig/pytudes][norvig/pytudes]] -- Jupyter notebooks to explain cool things
pretty beautiful examples of Jupyter as a medium for...learning + experimenting about things.
* [[http://www.quantum.country][quantum.country]] -- spaced repetition textbook on quantum mechanics
* [[https://observablehq.com/@ketan0][Observable]] -- d3.js notebooks to explain cool things
- interactive Javascript notebooks for data viz with D3. Noice.
* [[http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction][Ladder of Abstraction - Bret Victor]] -- explaining a concept at different levels, interactively.
I just love the ladder + arrow keys thing at the top. You can physically move between the different levels of explanation.
