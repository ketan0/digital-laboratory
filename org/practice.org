Things to talk about in the context of practice:

- being [[id:28ad325b-5438-4b37-aa60-607d54ee84c1][intentional]] in your pursuits, e.g.
  + violin. Practicing /sautille/ bowing technique, working on left-hand mechanics separately from right hand, etc.
  + programming.
  + typing on [[https://www.keyhero.com][keyhero]]
  + having fun (yes, I'm serious, you can practice having fun)

I feel that there's some relation of practice to [[id:05869b17-92db-4a55-9367-cdc409938bc9][mindfulness]] as well. Something about "holding the whole program in your head,"
