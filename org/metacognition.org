Why do some people learn so much so well? The simplest hypothesis is
that they've come across some better ways to learn! Perhaps such "gifts"
are little more than tricks of "higher-order" expertise. Just as one child
learns to re-arrange its building-blocks in clever ways, another child
might learn to play, inside its head, at re-arranging how it learns! -- Marvin Minsky,  https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/ComputersCantThink.txt
