#+title: Language learning as language use: A cross-linguistic model of child language development.

* Notes
In this model, comprehension and production are two sides of the same coin.
** Comprehension task
The model "chunks" the input utterance, incrementing the count of that chunk in the chunkatory.
#+begin_src python :results output
chunkatory = dict()
# for each sentence...
# TODO: write the pseudocode for chunkify

chunks = chunkify(sentence) # uses running avg. of BTPs
for chunk in chunks:
    chunkatory[chunk] += 1
#+end_src
** Production task
Given a "bag of words" derived from a child utterance, model has to figure out how to put it in the right order.

Of the longest chunks, select that with the highest BTP given the previous item.
#+begin_src python :results output
# first phase: chunkify the input
bag_of_words_chunks = # ...
# second phase: pull out the chunks
output = ''
prev_item = '<start>'
bag_of_words = # { set, of, all, input, words }
while bag_of_words is not empty:
    output += get_highest_BTP_chunk(bag_of_words_chunks)
#+end_src
