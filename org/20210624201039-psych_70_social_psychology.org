#+title: PSYCH 70: Social Psychology

* Introduction
Think about a time you were happy / a time you were sadâ€”were other people involved? We often experience emotions as a result of someone else.

** Social psychology is not new.
Philosophers have been intuitively (if not quite scientifically) thinking about these ideas for centuries!

"Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy." - Aristotle

** Social psychology is not (always) intuitive.
Example: [[https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/fine.pdf][introducing a fine]] for late-picker-uppers of kids at daycare actually /increases/ the number of late pick-ups. Explanation? The /motivation/ shifted from intrinsic to extrinsic.
** What is social psychology?
About understanding the "causal architecture" of the society that we're embedded in.

Three parts of the class: social cognition, interpersonal processes, everyday life.
*** Levels of organization:
Societies <=> *Groups* <=> *Individual* <=> *Mind* <=> Neurons/Genes/Hormones
^social psych is focused on the middle three levels.
* [[file:20210704202541-cognitive_biases.org][Cognitive Biases]]: self-serving biases.
** Motivated reasoning
/Motivated reasoning/ is our tendency to come to conclusions that make us feel good.

We don't like to admit when we're wrong! (Nor our sports heroes, family, political candidates, etc.)

Group affiliation: "We crushed them!" when your team wins vs. "They were terrible" when your team loses.

Above-average effect: people believe they are above average in valued domains (lol.) BUT in other domains that are seen as really hard (e.g. juggling or living past 100,) we see the below-average effect. The reason: we "anchor" to our initial estimate. E.g. for living to 100, we initially think it's very unlikely, then adjust the estimate upward as we get evidence.

Dunning-Kruger Effect: Correlation between lower skills and greater Above-Average Effect. In other words, correlation between cognitive and metacognitive skills. (Also, those with the most skills underestimate a little!)
** Why do we have these biases?
One answer: self-esteem. (But why do we need self-esteem, evolutionarily?)
Another answer: overconfidence gives social benefits?
** ...is there another way?
Hubristic pride = arrogant/conceited.
Authentic pride = confident, high self-esteem.
* Person Perception
/Should I date this person? Is this person guilty? How competent is this person?/

*Person perception* is forming impressions about other people.
** Thin Slicing
People can make predictive judgments "instantly" -- predicting future success, marriage success, sales performance, sexual orientation, etc. (Cue /Blink/ by Malcolm Gladwell, lol.)

Women can predict hetero/homosexual at higher rates when ovulating

These "thin slice" judgments can be surprisingly predictive, but also biased.

*** Why?
There is evolutionary value in swiftly identifying potential threats, mates, and leaders.
** Universal Dimensions of Social Cognition: Warmth and Competence
** Oh yeah, there's also the whole triangle and circe thing -- we immediately make judgments about what they're doing.
(But she should've mentioned that autistic people don't see this the same way)
** Confirmation bias:
Tendency to want to verify our pre-existing beliefs.
** Pygmalion Effect:
kids whose teachers thought the kids were "late bloomers" -- it actually came true.

Side note: whoa. Intuitively I feel like (and I'm of course enjoying that sweet confirmation bias) but it confirms my intuitions -- in cases where I've set high, clear expectations for myself, I've achieved them.
** [[file:20210627180445-self_fulfilling_prophecy.org][Self-fulfilling prophecy]]
You have expectations about someone => you behave accordingly towards them => they behave just how you expected => reinforces your expectations...

This seems like a kind of [[file:20210626152258-positive_feedback_loop.org][positive feedback loop]] that can either go really well, or really badly. Parents have a huge role in establishing expectations for their children. (As a first-born son / grandson, I know this firsthand ðŸ˜…)
* [[file:20210704202541-cognitive_biases.org][Cognitive Biases]]: cognitive dissonance theory
Cognitive Dissonance Theory:
- cognitive dissonance :: holding apparently incompatible / logically inconsistent thoughts about the world.
** How to resolve dissonance between A and B?
You can *disregard* one.
You can *change* your belief in one.
You can *distort* one.
You can *add* C that resolves the conflict.

Which one to choose? Will probably go with the path of least resistance.

Chicago doomsday cult didn't see doomsday => rationalized by saying that the Guardians had stopped the flood

1755 Lisbon earthquake => threatened belief in God and a just world.
** Is dissonance reduction good?
Good: it allows you to streamline cognition.
Bad: it loses the inherent complexity / ambiguity in the world.

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. - Ralph Waldo Emerson
#+end_quote
** Motivated reasoning is a key element in cognitive dissonance.
Severity of initiation: we have a deep-seated belief that we're not gullible etc. Motivated reasoning leads us to believe that the task was actually interesting, rather than that we're just gullible.
** Behavior precedes thought
Spreading of alternatives: we post-hoc try to "justify" our decisions in life to ourselves.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: change behaviors in people's lives to change their psychology positively.

Don't /think/ like you're the person you want to be, /act/ the way you want to be and become that person.
