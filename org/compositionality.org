You have a set of reusable pieces that can be combined to form different, interesting things.

Decomposition of [[id:0997b060-ee05-458e-beed-3494675c879d][programs]] into modular, reusable unit is one example of this.

Some methodical activities, such as making breakfast, decompose well into modular activities as well:

A [[id:5b02540a-15ac-4123-86f8-e6ca5420ce27][machine learning]] example of compositionaity is that a [[id:27d08270-d161-4bb1-8b39-50f28b1ab668][computer vision]] model's early layers will implement an edge detector, curve detector, etc., which are modular pieces that are then combined in various ways by higher-level layers to form dog detectors, car detectors, etc.

One step towards compositionality is the idea of neuro-symbolic models. Combining logic-based systems with connectionist methods.
