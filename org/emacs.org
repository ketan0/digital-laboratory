* Cool configs
** [[https://gitlab.com/justinekizhak/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/doom.d/config.org][justinekizhak]]
I like the motivation he gives for why emacs is so damn cool. "Emacs changes how you /think/ about programming." I feel like this has been very true for me. It makes many other applications seem needlessly restrictive. It feels natural to have the entire OS be an introspectable operating system.

Something crashing? Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html][Edebug]] to debug it. Something slow? You can easily [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Profiling.html][profile]] it.
** lisp macros
Really powerful feature that allows one to define domain-specific syntax /within/ Emacs Lisp. Examples I really like include [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Rx-Notation.html][rx notation]], and so many more that enable someone to write expressive, parsimonious code in a [[id:95ff3fb3-f886-41df-9f4f-5f9223b4ca4e][bottom-up]] fashion.
