#+title: ablation studies

Ablation studies are effectively using [[id:d68c5093-d6d6-43b8-a48d-629ade9293b6][interventions]] (removing parts of your system) to reveal the underlying causal structure of your system. Francois Chollet (creator of Keras) writes about this being useful in a [[id:5b02540a-15ac-4123-86f8-e6ca5420ce27][machine learning]] context:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ablation studies are crucial for deep learning research -- can&#39;t stress this enough.<br><br>Understanding causality in your system is the most straightforward way to generate reliable knowledge (the goal of any research). And ablation is a very low-effort way to look into causality.</p>&mdash; Fran√ßois Chollet (@fchollet) <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1012721582148550662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
