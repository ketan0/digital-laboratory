#+title: simplicity

#+begin_quote
Simplicity is a great virtue, but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better. - Edsger W. Dijkstra.

It seems like as life goes on, [[id:9648399a-daf3-44a0-8612-a3d84b99d0c1][complexity]] just kinda accumulates sometimes. In some cases it might be unavoidable -- we grow older and have more responsibilities, a codebase matures and takes on more functionality, etc. But it seems like simplicity is a good ideal to strive for, in certain ways.
