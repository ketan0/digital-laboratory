#+title: ethos of this digital garden

# NOTE: eventually would love to have a section on like, evergreen vs working notes. or blog posts / "finished thoughts" vs unfinished thoughts.
* i'm working on it
which might become apparent, when you run into unfinished thoughts, TODOs, dead ends, etc. etc. many things are under construction!
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400 :alt prompt was "a complex web of underground holes being dug by groundhogs, with construction signs at dead ends. cartoon style"

* i want to think / work in public
hopefully this d.g. would be networked with other people's too at some pt
* traversing it should be like a natural form of spaced repetition
ideally, with the right graph structure, the most important concepts / nodes should have a lot of ingoing and outgoing links to / fro them. so traversing the garden would naturally lead me to review things i think are important.
