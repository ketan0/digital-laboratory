[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming][Richard Hamming]] gave a talk that's gained an increasing cult following in recent years. Drawing on his experience from Bell Labs, he lists some the characteristics of the top researchers there (including himself.)

* Work with the door open.

Hamming noticed that working with the office door closed, while good for productivity in the short-term, ended up hurting researchers in the long run. If you don't "work with the door open," so to speak, you might miss the actual important problems.
* Sometimes "faults," from another viewpoint, can actually be assets.

:END:
Back in the day when machines were painstakingly programmed in binary, Bell Labs wouldn't give Hamming the personnel required to do that; while this could be seen as a "fault," it actually made him become one of the earliest adopters of automatic programming. Similar drives led [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper][Grace Hopper]] and others to invent high-level programming language.
* Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.
